                            <p>It requires a connection to our own emotions and a lot of curiosity about others to truly understand what makes a moment – a moment. We can struggle for a lifetime to understand one another. Maybe because we struggle to understand ourselves or because we are too caught up by things that do not really matter to enjoy what really does.</br></p>
                            <p>When we allow ourselves to feel, we find keys to reactions, emotions, and laughter. It takes bravery to reach it because brave people never deny themselves what they truly want. We believe this is how we create moments that feel equal and reach far beyond the situation, a relationship, the event or even the photography captured of it. That is why we are on a journey within, to reach out. We always strive to create the ultimate experience. In other words, we strive to create a 21.AGENCY moment.</br></p>
                            <p>21.AGENCY is a unique Web development agency offering tailor-made services to individuals and companies who wish to amplify their online experience. While we are mostly known for our spectacular coding, our services also include creative Web development, UX & UI Design and Social media.</br></p>
                            <p>21.AGENCY started in spring 2019 with four learners from Simplon who shared the same vision about Web development. Today 21.AGENCY consists of four developers with different backgrounds. Together we have an extensive experience in Music, Coding and Production and have learned firsthand the necessary ingredients for coding to stand-out. We aim to leverage this experience to help clients strengthen their online publication.</br></p>
